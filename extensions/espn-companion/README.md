# The War Room — ESPN Draft Companion

Manifest V3 Chrome extension that passively observes ESPN fantasy-football draft state and reconciles completed picks into The War Room.

## Current status

Version 0.9.14 observes structured data ESPN's own page receives through WebSocket, fetch, XHR, EventSource, and bounded React-state inspection. A unified ledger reconciles those observations by overall pick and ESPN player ID. ESPN's REST draft-detail response is retained as a snapshot/recovery source, and visible Pick History/Board parsing remains the final fallback. This architecture is implemented and replay-tested, but structured live capture still requires a disposable live-mock validation before it should be relied on for a real draft.

The extension does **not** read or store ESPN passwords, cookies, authentication headers, or tokens. Page observers are read-only: they do not create draft actions, alter ESPN payloads, or make duplicate live-data requests. Only normalized pick candidates and sanitized structural telemetry cross into extension storage.

## Install locally

1. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Turn on **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this `extensions/espn-companion` folder.
5. Open The War Room from either:
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`
   - `http://localhost:8765/`
   - `https://ryan42062001.github.io/The-War-Room/`
6. Open an ESPN fantasy-football mock or live draft in another Chrome tab.
7. Open the extension popup. Confirm that both ESPN and The War Room show as connected.
8. Press **Rescan ESPN** after the draft room finishes loading.
9. After any extension code update, return to `chrome://extensions` and press **Reload** on the companion card. The popup shows the installed version and warns when the open War Room requires a newer build.

Chrome displays an extension popup over the upper-right corner of the current page. It is not part of ESPN and closes as soon as you click the draft room. Use **Open controls in a tab** if you want status to stay visible without covering ESPN. The extension-icon badge shows the captured-pick count while the popup is closed.

## How synchronization works

```text
ESPN WebSocket / fetch / XHR / React state (structured live capture)
  -> espn-live-observer.js (MAIN world, passive observation)
  -> espn-live-capture.js (normalization and sanitized telemetry)
  -> espn-content.js
ESPN REST draft snapshot + Pick History/Board DOM (recovery/fallback)
  -> espn-page-bridge.js / espn-api.js / espn-parser.js
  -> background.js (ID-first, conflict-aware unified pick ledger)
  -> war-room-content.js
  -> window message contract
  -> applyEspnDraftSnapshot() in The War Room
  -> existing board updates + autosave
```

- Overall picks are deduplicated across all sources and stored by the extension.
- Matching ESPN player IDs confirm an observation; disagreements are retained as visible conflicts instead of silently overwritten.
- Structured sources use ESPN's actual team ID to determine `Mine` versus `Taken` when it is present.
- REST snapshots can recover structured records but are no longer treated as proof that the live feed is authoritative.
- Board fallback derives snake-draft team slots from overall pick and league size.
- The popup lists the exact captured pick numbers and players currently classified as `Mine`.
- The website reconciles the complete ESPN snapshot instead of blindly replaying clicks.
- ESPN player ID is used first when the website has learned it; FantasyPros canonical-name, suffix-tolerant, and DST matching are fallbacks.
- ESPN-sourced rows carry `data-sync-source="espn"`, allowing a later full snapshot to repair missed or corrected picks.

## Draft-night safeguards

- Keep manual marking available as a fallback.
- Verify the Captured, Applied, and Unmatched counts after the first few mock-draft picks.
- If Captured is greater than Applied, press **Rescan ESPN**. Version 0.9.0 keeps acknowledgments monotonic, forces a React-state rescan, and resends one trailing snapshot while retaining the terminal-pick and post-draft safeguards from 0.8.11.
- Use **Copy diagnostics** to capture the installed/required versions, connection method, sync counts, completion state, and structured API status without exposing ESPN credentials.
- Follow `LIVE_VALIDATION.md` for the two remaining full-draft checks: Direct mode and forced Board fallback.
- Prefer **Draft detected · Live capture** with Structured page state or Network observation active. If only **Board fallback** is active, open ESPN's Board or Pick History tab once and press Rescan.
- The Live capture panel distinguishes structured page state, network observation, Board fallback, and confirmed/conflicting picks. REST status remains available in diagnostics as supporting evidence.
- If ESPN's pick-history view falls behind, any visible player row explicitly labeled **DRAFTED** is suppressed from War Room recommendations without guessing its pick number or ownership.
- If Unmatched is nonzero, manually mark that player and record the exact ESPN display name so an alias or selector fixture can be added.
- Use **Clear captured picks** only before starting a new mock or real draft.

## FantasyPros rankings

FantasyPros rankings are updated by importing the official Top-20 PPR CSV through The War Room. The retired public-API experiment returned only 10 players per consensus request and did not provide documented pagination, so version 0.9.12 removes the FantasyPros API controls and host permission. On first load it also deletes the previously saved FantasyPros API key and cached API state from extension storage. ESPN synchronization and ESPN board/ADP refresh do not require that key.

## Test

From this directory:

```powershell
npm test
```

The tests cover ESPN pick text variants, round-to-overall conversion, snake turns, defenses, player IDs, and rejection of undrafted queue/player-list text.

## Why this is currently a monorepo package

The extension and website share a versioned sync message contract. Keeping them together for the first version prevents protocol drift and makes end-to-end testing easier. The folder contains no imports from the parent repository and can be moved into a separate repository later if it is published independently.
